ABSTRACT

Recognizing sarcasm in text is an important task for Natural Language processing to avoid misinterpretation of sarcastic statements as literal statements. Accuracy and robustness of NLP models are often affected by untruthful sentiments that are often of sarcastic nature. Thus, it is important to filter out noisy data from the training data inputs for various NLP related tasks.Sarcasm sentences have variable grammatical structures and are used almost in all topics. To understand sarcasm, one has to know the context of the sentence it is being used in. For this very reason, sarcasm detection in text data is difficult due to the lack of intonation and facial expressions. Many researchers in the past have attempted to narrow down baseline features to create an optimal ML algorithm to increase accuracy in detecting sarcasm in text. 

In this project, I too, will attempt to design a machine learning algorithm for sarcasm detection in text by leveraging the work done by Mathieu Cliche of www.thesarcasmdetector.com and improving upon it. The project mainly aims to analyze Tweets from Twitter and classify them as either Sarcastic or Non Sarcastic.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Recognizing sarcasm in text is an important task for Natural Language processing to avoid misinterpretation of sarcastic statements as literal statements. The use of sarcasm is prevalent across all social media, micro-blogging and e-commerce platforms. Sarcasm detection is imperative for accurate sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

Through this project, an appropriate corpus is create with the use of twitter data, the data is pre-processed, sanitized and properly vectorized (transformed). Following this, this dataset is trained and tested using Logistic Regression Algorithm to predict whether a given data is Sarcastic or Non Sarcastic.
